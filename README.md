# BQML Demo #

## Overview ##
The repository contains BigQuery ML templates for commo marketing use cases. The templates use synthetic data, which was generated as per below use case and schema.
* Customer is a B2B office supplier: OS Inc
* OS Inc's customers are businesses whose information is stored in CRM in Account object
* End users of these businesses login to OS's ecommerce website to order supplies; End user information (demographics, etc) is stored in the User object in CRM
* Website activity of each user is tracked in GA360

Though these templates are based on a fictitious B2B company, the modeling techniques and methods apply equally to a B2C scenario as well.
